    Some meta information about this document:

    * I use the GitHub flavor of markdown.
    See [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) for how to use it.

    * I follow the one sentence per line approach which I came across several years ago when learning AsciiDoc(tor).
    See [https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line) for the reasoning behind this approach.

# The Documentation Vault

Describes a **set of workflows** built upon [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and two Git repositories [main](https://github.com/martinleggewie/documentationvault_main) and [userextension](https://github.com/martinleggewie/documentationvault_userextension) to **document meetings as they happen** and to **schedule and assign tasks** in a professional, work-related context.

These workflows strive to meet the following main requirements:

* Be suitable not only for a single person, but also for a small amount of people working in a team.
* Allow to work offline, and only need to connect to the Internet once in a while.
* Use tools which are all publicly available and hence free of charge.
* Use tools which work on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

This tutorial consists of two main parts: 

* **[Part 1 explains how to use it](how-to-use.md)**.
If you first like to know how the workflows work and how they look and feel (and if you are not afraid of reading about quite a collection of keyboard shortcuts), then start with this part.

* **[Part 2 explains how to set it all up](how-to-configure.md)**.
If you are interested in which tools you would need to install on your machine, and how to set them up, then have a look here.

Closing note: I have developed these workflows based on my experience gained when developing and using <https://martinleggewie.github.io/documentationmode>.

Of course I hope that these workflows and their underlying tool setup are something which would also suit your demands.
But even if you don't want to use them, you maybe can get some inspiration out of this tutorial which supports you in case you struggle with your own workflows.
