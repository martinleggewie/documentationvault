# The Documentation Vault - How to use

## Abstract

This document describes **several workflows for a small group of people working together** to

- **document meetings** that have happened or are currently going on,
- **describe and schedule tasks** which need to be done by someone, and
- **find information** quickly, typically while a meeting is just going on.

In addition there are some more workflows which enable you to

- **document some knowledge** which is longer-lasting and might also be interesting for the group, and
- **keep some personal diary** to document things which are only to be visible by the group member who wrote it.

As we live in the digital world, we do need some digital tooling which enable us using these workflows:

* As the main tool I use [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md).
Obsidian works on a so-called "vault" which is mainly a folder containing all your content in the form of Markdown text files plus a sub-folder ".obsidian" which stores the configuration, plug-ins, and themes.

* In addition, and somehow "below Obsidian", I use **Git** to manage all the files which either you create or which I already prepared to provide my opinionated structure and setup of how we should use Obsidian.

In the [other part of this document](how-to-configure.md) you will find information about how to configure all this.
But even with best configuration, tools are just tools, and they still need to be used by us.

By the way:
These workflows and how they are configured are heavily influenced by its ancestor document ["The Documentation Mode"](https://martinleggewie.github.io/documentationmode) in which I describe the more or less same types of workflows, but use Emacs and the in-built Org mode instead of Obsidian.
So, in case you would like to know more about the roots of and the motivation for these workflows, you might consider checking this other documentation as well.


## Introduction

In this document I will define scenarios in which we either have to document something (that is, we create new content or change existing content) or have to find back something which we created earlier.
For each of these scenarios **I describe how the corresponding workflow using Obsidian and/or Git works**.

Each such scenario is somehow triggered by an event which just has ocurred or is about to happen.
Typical examples of such events are:

* A phone call happening
* An email coming in
* An idea just popping up into your mind
* A colleague talking to you
* A meeting taking place
* Some knowledge being gathered, for example by reading a news article or a book
* A task needing to be done by someone

The first step directly after such an event has occurred is to bring ourselves in a "documentation mode" as soon as possible.
**The goal is to document (that is, write notes) while the event is still ongoing** because a) we normally don't have the time to do this afterwards, and b) the chances are lower that we forget to write down important information.

It takes a bit of practise to be able to participate in a discussion, and at the same time take some notes.
In case you realize that you cannot cope with doing both, I recommend to just make it transparent to the other participants.
Say something like: "Oh, could we please just wait a minute, I would like to take some notes before we continue."
From my experience others don't have a problem with having to wait a few seconds before the discussion can move on.

And:
- If you force yourself (and the others) to write down what has just been said during a meeting, you can validate if you (and the others) have understood this correctly.
- You can offer to send your notes as minutes of meeting right after the meeting, as some kind of convenience service.
Typically, people are more than happy to show some little patience if they don't have to write the minutes themselves.

Coming back to "We document all relevant information":
What exactly the relevant information is depends heavily on the concrete event.
It can only be you to decide on a case-by-case basis what to note down and what not.
This decision becomes even more difficult as you don't know what others think about the importance of information.
Besides, when such an event starts, it can happen that you don't know which direction the event will take.
It can happen that the scenario actually changes or extends during the event.
A beginning like "Erm, do you have a minute or two, I would like to discuss some small topic with you" which results in a half-hour phone call with three follow-up tasks does not sound too exotic.
But this is (professional) life which you cannot really change, but you can become prepared.

Therefore, I compiled the following list of workflows which can give you a guideline for how to document such scenarios.
For each workflow I assume that you have Obsidian properly configured, opened, and in focus.
Sometimes you need to start other workflows while the original workflow is still ongoing.

Typical example:
You are in a meeting scenario, and you have already started the corresponding meeting workflow.
Suddenly you realize that you also have to create a task because this is one of the results of that very meeting.
You deal with this situation by just starting a new workflow for planning a task.
Once you have finished the task planning scenario, you can just continue with the meeting scenario.

So, enough of the pre-talk â€“ let's get started with something concrete.
On a high-level, there are two types of scenarios:
Either you need to document something, or you need to find back something which you have documented in the past.
The two following main sections deal with exactly these two types.
